* Collision Detection → The game checks for collisions between the bird and pipes, triggering game over when a collision occurs.

#### Game Screen and Composables
* Bird Composable → The player-controlled bird/ship/doge is implemented as a Composable, responding to user input for flying and gravity for falling.
* Score Display → A score counter keeps track of the player's progress and is displayed on the screen.
* Background → The game's background sets the visual atmosphere and can change based on the theme.

#### Game Logic and Interaction
* User Input → Players interact by tapping or clicking the screen to control the jetpack character's upward movement.
* Physics → The game simulates gravity, creating an upward movement when the player taps.
* Collision Handling → Collisions between the jetpack character and obstacles result in game over and score display.
